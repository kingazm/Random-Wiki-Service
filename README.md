# How to use it?

Important note: to run the app, you must have Python installed.
To do that first, go to the link below and follow the instrutions on the official Python website:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Having python on your computer, download the generator.py file.
The text file will be created on your computer locally if it does not already exist.

To run .py program, open Command Line in the directory of the folder you've saved the generator.py or manually go to that path using
cd (here goes folder you want to enter)
This may take a couple of commands, depending on where exactly is the file.

You can check if you've entered the right folder by using
ls
which lists all the elements in the directory.

After entering the folder with generator.py, type
python generator.py (or python3 generator.py on MacOS)

And voile'a! The app is running in the Command Line!
